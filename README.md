# Python for Engineers-- Update

In 2017, I made my book _Python for Engineers_ free with help from the community. In the years since, due to personal issues, I have archived the site, and taken my books offline, as I didnt have time to update them.

I got so many messages asking me to bring back the books, I've decided to update everything-- all my books and blogs.

But the task is huge, so Im asking for help.

## What's needed
09)
I need someone to go over my books/articles, run them, and check the code still works. I have been updating Python for Engineers(the book, and found that 90% of the code works, but a few libraries have changed, and so the code needed updating.

You dont need to fix the code, just tell me what is failing.


## What You get

All my books for free, including any updated versions. Plus your name in the thank you page -- and a link to your blog/Linkedin etc. See the _Special Thanks_ section here: [https://www.pythonforengineers.com/python-for-scientists-and-engineers/](https://www.pythonforengineers.com/python-for-scientists-and-engineers/)


## Some lessons learnt

In 2017, the last time I asked for help, I found a 100 people were interested, but 80% didnt even complete the basic step of creating a github account, and of the remaining, 10-15% vanished in a few days.

If you want your name and link to your blog in the Thanks section, you need to stick with it.

Im talking about 1-3 hours a week for the next 4-5 weeks-- you can do it in the evenings/weekend. Only basic knowledge of Python is needed.
